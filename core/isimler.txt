It's just me against the world
Ooh, ooh
Nothin' to lose,
It's just me against the world baby
Oh, ah ah
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Oh-hahhh
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin'
There ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket, the aftermath
More bodies being buried, I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, 'cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin' no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
Ooh yeah, ooh-hoo
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world baby
Hey!
Me against the world
Ooh yeah
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
I got nothin' to lose
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
And screamin' I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Ever'day there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin'
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
When I gets to pervin', so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin' sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Ooh yeah, ooh-ooh
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
Oh oh
Ha ha
It's just me against the world baby
Ha-ah, ha ah!
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world, ho ah
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest? Through this suppression
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress, to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Oh ah
I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
Me against the world
Heh, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
